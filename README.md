## Project Goals:
Build a functional website for users to create, edit, delete, and view their recipes. During this build, I plan to improve my skills in Python while working with Django Models. I will practice creating class based views vs function based views, and continue to improve my skills working in HTML Templates, and utilize CSS and Bootstrap to style my page, putting an emphasis on design and usability throughout all aspects of this project.

## Start it up:
- Clone this repository into a fresh directory on your computer
- Create a virtual environment. Make sure you are in the freshly cloned folder when you do this!
